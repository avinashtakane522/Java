Hi I am preparing for the interview preparation for the Java developer and now I am learning the multitading part and I have some set of questions so answer me very manner .
So tell me about the atomic classes in concurrency.atomic package and all the atomic classes in brief { 
1. Executer Framework, 2. Thread pools, 3. Types of Thread Pools 4. Thread pool executors 5. Callable Interface, 6. Future Interface 
}like that with questions and answer and keeping mind like I want to talk at least 1 minute on each above topic topic so answer in easy English and simple words and at least 5 line


Hereâ€™s a concise QA-style explanation for the listed exceptions, keeping the answers short and to the point:

---

### 1. **What is ConcurrentModificationException?**  
**Example Interview Talk Point:**  
"This exception occurs when a thread tries to modify a collection while another thread is iterating over it. It signals unsafe modifications, often encountered in ArrayLists or HashMaps without synchronization."

---

### 2. **What is BrokenBarrierException?**  
**Example Interview Talk Point:**  
"This exception is thrown when a thread waiting at a CyclicBarrier is interrupted or when the barrier is broken. It occurs in scenarios where coordination between threads using the barrier is disrupted."

---

### 3. **What is ExecutionException?**  
**Example Interview Talk Point:**  
"This exception wraps any exception that occurs during the execution of a task submitted to an Executor. It typically signals issues in asynchronous computations."

---

### 4. **What is IllegalMonitorStateException?**  
**Example Interview Talk Point:**  
"This exception is thrown when a thread tries to call `wait()`, `notify()`, or `notifyAll()` on an object without holding its intrinsic lock. It highlights improper use of synchronization."

---

### 5. **What is RejectedExecutionException?**  
**Example Interview Talk Point:**  
"This exception indicates that a task cannot be accepted for execution, often because the thread pool is full or has been shut down."

---

### 6. **What is TimeoutException?**  
**Example Interview Talk Point:**  
"This exception is thrown when a blocking operation times out, such as waiting for a result or acquiring a lock. It signals that the operation couldn't complete within the allowed time."

---

### 7. **What is CancellationException?**  
**Example Interview Talk Point:**  
"This exception is thrown when an asynchronous task is canceled before it completes. It usually occurs with tasks managed by the Future interface."

---

### 8. **What is CompletionException?**  
**Example Interview Talk Point:**  
"This exception wraps exceptions thrown during asynchronous computations in the CompletableFuture API. It helps propagate the cause of a failure in concurrent tasks."

---

Let me know if you need further examples or details for any of these exceptions!


There are some below exception in multithreading let me know QA like above now u decide how it lines conatin in answer it preffered less lines for this 

ConcurrentModification, BrokenBarrier, ExecutionException, IllegaleMonitorStateException, RejectedExecution, Timeout, Cancellation, ComplectionExeception
